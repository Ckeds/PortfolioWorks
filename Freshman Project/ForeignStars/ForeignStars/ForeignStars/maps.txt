TODO: Write up the readme for how maps work

Map definitions use xml files in order to describe their structure in a human readable format.

A map must be placed in the root it belongs, e.g. for battle maps, place the map definition in <BattleMaps></BattleMaps>

an example map format is like so:

<map id="0" size ="20">
    <tile length="400" terrain="grass"></tile>
    <spawn location="0,0,5,5"></spawn>
  </map>

  We start with a starting map tag <map>
  <map> has attributes that describe the map
  ID - the id of the map is the unique id assigned to the map to distinguish it from others when loading (or modifying)
  Size - Maps are always square, so size defines the length and width of the map, in our example we have size="20" - this indicates
  a map with a size square of 20x20, meaning an area of 400.

  Inside the map tag, we have additional tags that describe the map
  <tile> - <tile> describes the tiles on a map, and how long the tile is.
		length - the length of the tile is its consecutive length, e.g. a length of 40 on a 20x20 map will place 2 rows of 20 tiles of the specified type
		terrain - the terrain is the type of terrain that the tiles will represent


Note to self= possibly include an "exempt" attribute for spawn areas, to indicate like a tree where they cannot spawn
//make a minimum size for spawn points, os that all the units in an army can fit
